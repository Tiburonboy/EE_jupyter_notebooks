This JupyterLab notebook walks through some of the analysis found in the paper, [A Bandpass Twin-T Active Filter Used in the Buchla 200 Electric Music Box Synthesizer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11358). The paper describes a third order bandpass filter (BPF) employed in the Buchla Model 295 10 Channel Comb Filter, a synthesizer module developed as part of the Buchla 200 Electric Music Box. The BPF described has a unique arrangement of elements not found in the typical Twin-T configuration, which makes this BPF a interesting candiditate to study.
