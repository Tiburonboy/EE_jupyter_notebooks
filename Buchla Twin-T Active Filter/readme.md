***Abstract***: The JupyterLab notebooks in this folder are an analysis of a band pass filter using Symbolic Modified Nodal Analysis implemented with Python in a JupyterLab Notebook then rendered into a PDF. The report builds on the work, *A Bandpass Twin-T Active Filter Used in the Buchla 200 Electric Music Box Synthesizer*, by Aaron D. Lanterman. The report continues with related analysis, thoughts and observations about the filter topology. The use of SymPy makes generating the node equations and obtainig analalytic solutions for the node voltages almost efferortless. 

The main notebook has been rendered into a PDF: `Twin-T_Active_Bandpass_Filter.pdf`

The source material for the PDF file is: `Twin-T_Active_Bandpass_Filter.ipynb`
