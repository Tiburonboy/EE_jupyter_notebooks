    "# Password card\n",
    "last update: 2 Feb 2023  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Abstract\n",
    "This notebook describes the use of a password card and the Python code that generates the password card. The password card is a grid of random letters, numbers and special characters that provides a convenient aid to generate and remember long and complex passwords. A basic description of the password card and instructions are provided along with the Python code used to generate the password card. A security analysis and an analysis of alternatives is provided. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "Coming up with secure passwords and remembering a unique password for each account is a challenge. The safest way to store your passwords is to memorize them, but for long and complex passwords this is not practical. Passwords that humans can remember and use are guessable. The password card described in this notebook is a paper card that once generated is off-line, an independent record of your passwords and is protected by a secret word that you memorize. In one sense, the password card is a [Password manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_manager), but it is not computerized.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "This notebook describes the generation and use of a password card similar to the card called \"C@RD\", a laminated card sold by [Russtopia Labs](https://russtopialabs.bigcartel.com/product/c-rdtm-password-generator-recall-card) for \\$4.25. The password card provides an easy way to generate and remember long and complex passwords. The version of the card described here has the upper case letters of the alphabet printed on line number one of the card. The card consists of an array of letters, numbers and special characters that can be used as passwords for web pages and can be printed on a credit-card sized piece of paper which can be laminated and carried in your wallet or pocket. A sample card is shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"password_card_example.png\" width=\"350\">  \n",
    "\n",
    "The first three rows are the upper case letters of the alphabet, the lower case letters, the special characters and numbers used on the card. All the characters used in the passwords are printed here as a reference since for some fonts, some characters are hard to distinguish, for example, l and 1. Rows four through nine are random combinations of the letters of the alphabet, numbers and special characters. The columns of rows four through nine contain the characters used in the passwords and each column contains at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit and one special character in addition to two randomly selected characters, for a total of six characters. The last row on the card is a random sequence of numbers that can be used for numerical PINs. \n",
    "\n",
    "The passwords for your accounts are generated from two parts, the first part of your password comes from the card, the second part is a secret word, committed to memory, consisting of a combination of letters, numbers or special characters that only you know. When combined, the combination yields passwords which are complex and of adequate length for most applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good passwords have the following characteristics:\n",
    "- They do not contain personal information or common words\n",
    "- They do not contain words or phrases from songs lyrics, poetry, literature etc.\n",
    "- They are long enough to resist brute force guessing attacks from current and future password cracking systems\n",
    "- They are not from a list of previously compromised passwords e.g. names, names with numbers or symbols, words from dictionaries etc.\n",
    "- They do not contain simple substitutions such as @ for a, 5 or \\$ for s, 1 for i, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which implies that the password should be random, not easily guessed and as a result can be hard to memorize. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Unique passwords for each account\n",
    "Each account should have a unique password. If the same password is used for multiple accounts, then all accounts using that same password are vulnerable if your reused password is compromised. This advice is almost universally given by security experts and journalists who write on the subject. [Credential stuffing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credential_stuffing) is a type of cyber attack in which the attacker collects stolen account credentials, typically consisting of lists of usernames and/or email addresses and the corresponding passwords (often from a data breach), and then uses the credentials to gain unauthorized access to user accounts on other systems through large-scale automated login requests directed against a web application. Unlike credential cracking, credential stuffing attacks do not attempt to use brute force or guess any passwords – the attacker simply automates the logins for a large number (thousands to millions) of previously discovered credential pairs using standard web automation tools. The best way to protect against credential stuffing is to use unique passwords on accounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other password cards\n",
    "The following are links to other types of password cards.\n",
    "- [PasswordCard](https://www.passwordcard.org/en): The user picks a row and column and reads the password in the direction chosen. Could be left, right or diagonal.\n",
    "- [Password card generator](https://www.averk.net/passgen.html): You can pick on a row, a column, click on random characters and/or draw images on your Password Card that are easy to remember. \n",
    "- [PassCard](https://github.com/cryptofuture/PassCard): similar to PasswordCard above\n",
    "- [PasswordWrench](https://www.passwordwrench.com/Public/OnlinePasswordGenerator): similar to  Password card generator above\n",
    "- [Qwertycards](https://www.qwertycards.com/): the password is a character substitution cipher of the web site's name.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Canadian patent\n",
    "The \"C@RD\" from Russtopia Labs was designed and patented in Canada and was protected under Canadian patent number [2,895,597](https://www.ic.gc.ca/opic-cipo/cpd/eng/patent/2895597/summary.html?type=number_search&tabs1Index=tabs1_1). In 2016 and 2019 the patent expired due to failure to respond and failure to pay application maintenance fee.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Password card instructions\n",
    "Instructions for the use of the card are provided by Russtopia Labs and are summarized here.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose a secret word or phrase known only to you. This ensures that even if your password card is lost or stolen, no one will know the full password you generate from the card. \n",
    "2. Using the first two letters of the website or name of the company holding your account, choose the appropriate columns and read downwards in rows four through six. Every column has at least one letter (both upper- and lower-case), a digit and a special character.\n",
    "\n",
    "The image below, shows the card with sections highlighted in colored boxes. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"password_card_example1.png\" width=\"350\">  \n",
    "\n",
    "Passwords are generated by using the first two letters of the website or company holding your account and then reading down the columns of rows four through six. If the web site is amazon.com, choose columns \"A\" and \"M\", and read the characters from rows four through six. These are highlighted in the black and blue boxes. In column \"A\" (in blue), the characters are \"8@%yP!\", and in column \"M\" (in black), the characters are \"kfoC?2\". If your personal secret word is \"apple\", then the full password for your amazon account would be \"8@%yP!kfoC?2apple\", which is a complex 17 character password containing upper and lower case letters, digits and special characters. Since you know the procedure, you don't have to remember the 17 characters, just use the procedure along with your card to reconstruct your password.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rotating passwords\n",
    "For rotating passwords, add two characters from rows four and five of numbered columns in row 3, (01=Jan), (02=Feb), for each month. (eg., \n",
    "in row four, two characters in column for 1st month digit, then two characters in column for 2nd month digit, February=02, under 0 in row four, read \"5e\". Then under 2 in row five, read \"dA\" and prefix to password. The resulting password would be \"5edA\" plus the remaining base password, \"5edA8#&yP!kfoC?2apple\". In three months or whenever the password expires, use the month to generate a new prefix. This is the procedure outlined by Russtopia Labs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some sites will check to see if the new password is sufficiently different than, say for example, the last ten passwords used. If the passwords are stored as a hashed value, then any difference, even one character difference would be sufficient. But if the prior passwords are stored as plain text or in an encrypted file, the system could check the degree of difference between old passwords and the new one. So if the site is enforcing a new password that is different from your old password by some amount of characters, then the following procedure can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the beginning of the year, in January for example, if a new password is required, construct the new password as follows:\n",
    "- The months are numbered from 1 to C as shown in the table below and the characters are from the column under that month number or letter. So in January, month number 1, use the characters from column 1 which are: 3bXz%f.\n",
    "- The next characters are from column A and M (for Amazon), but only three characters from each column are used: A = 8@% and M = kfo.\n",
    "- Then append your secret word.\n",
    "\n",
    "| month | col # | col chars | A col | M col | secret word |\n",
    "|-------|:-----:|:---------:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----------:|\n",
    "| Jan | 1 | 3bXz%f | 8@% | kfo | apple |\n",
    "| Feb | 2 | dAk)\\$1 | 8@% | kfo | apple |\n",
    "| Mar | 3 | ?y(1?J | 8@% | kfo | apple |\n",
    "| Apr | 4 | *-1@Ui | 8@% | kfo | apple |\n",
    "| May | 5 | 66!A$b | 8@% | kfo | apple |\n",
    "| Jun | 6 | &jcPQ6 | 8@% | kfo | apple |\n",
    "| Jul | 7 | mrc3B# | 8@% | kfo | apple |\n",
    "| Aug | 8 | ><^nJ7 | 8@% | kfo | apple |\n",
    "| Sep | 9 | 5DktW< | 8@% | kfo | apple |\n",
    "| Oct | A | 8@%yP! | 8@% | kfo | apple |\n",
    "| Nov | B | X4Mz+b | 8@% | kfo | apple |\n",
    "| Dec | C | ax!p2M | 8@% | kfo | apple |\n",
    "\n",
    "A new password for January would be: 3bXz%f8@%kfoapple. In April, if the password has to be changed, it would be: *-1@Ui8@%kfoapple. You only  need to remember in which month you created the new password.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Numeric PIN\n",
    "For a numeric PIN, pick a letter and start with that number in the random number row. For example, if your bank is Commerce Bank, under the letter \"C\" in the first row, the PIN numbers are \"141845\" (red highlight). You can use four numbers if you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "For sites that restrict the number of characters in the password, choose a 4-letter secret word and only read the first two or three symbols from each column in Step 2) above. This will give you an 8 or 10 character password to meet password restrictions of old systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Restricted characters\n",
    "For sites with restrict the use of special characters, read the columns as usual but each time you encounter a prohibited special character, use a letter instead (for example, \"<\" becomes \"n\", \">\" becomes \"o\" etc.) which are the letters in row two directly above the special characters in row three.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the website or account has repeated letters, for example \"aa.com\", this would result in using the same column \"a\" twice, which according to the original procedure is acceptable. However if you feel uncomfortable using a password with any repeated sequences, shift to the left or right adjacent column for the second letter – in essence treating \"aa\" as \"ab\" (second \"a\" becomes \"b\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, a user would keep a list of web page names and the corresponding user name, web site letter code and notes. The user would refer to this list for websites that are not often used or have restricted characters. The user would refer to the list until it became committed to memory. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Secret word selection\n",
    "The purpose of the secret word is to keep at least part of your password secret in the event that someone finds your password card. The secret word part is memorized and not written down anywhere. In the examples above, the secret word used was \"apple\". You should use something different.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are about 255 thousand defined words in the [Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary](https://www.amazon.com/Merriam-Websters-Collegiate-Dictionary-Laminated-Cover/dp/0877798079) English dictionary, choosing one random word out of a dictionary provides about 17 bits of entropy. Your secret word should have at least 30 bits of entropy, in order to prove a modest level of security. One random word would provide a bit of security that might keep a nosy family member out of your email account if they \"borrowed\" your password card. Two random words concatenated would provide about 35 bits of entropy, enough to keep even the most determined family member out of your email account. For example the two words, \"program\" and \"blind\" could be concatenated to generate a secret passphrase, \"programblind\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple random words concatenated is called a [passphrase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passphrase). The more words that are in the passphrase, the more secure it is, but harder to memorize. To prevent personal bias from affecting your choice of words you could use [dice](https://www.amazon.com/Bicycle-Dice-10-Die-Package/dp/B00508ZS40/ref=sr_1_2?crid=1EH91YNU25KT2&keywords=Bicycle+Dice%2C+10+Count&qid=1671131991&sprefix=bicycle+dice%2C+10+count%2Caps%2C139&sr=8-2) to aid in choosing words from the dictionary. Roll some dice and choose a dictionary page number based on the dice rolls. Roll the dice some more and choose a word on the page. Repeat until you have the number of words you want. One way to harden short passphrases is to mangle the passphase, for example \"programblind\" could be mangled to be \"pRogram=bli2nd\". Not impossible to memorize, but nearly impossible to guess. With the password card, \"pRogram=bli2nd\" is the only part you need to commit to memory. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Python Code\n",
    "This section of the notebook contains the Python code used to generate the password card. The Python library [Secrets](https://docs.python.org/3/library/secrets.html) is used to randomly choose elements from the character set. The secrets module is used for generating cryptographically strong random numbers suitable for managing data such as passwords, account authentication, security tokens, and related secrets. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Python code described below can be used to generate a unique card for each person. "

The particular pass phrase \"a@vowedlyhesitAn0ce\" is but one instance in a vast pool of possible passphrases built with the algorithm. The hacker would need to try a vast number of three word combinations with a random capital letter, symbol and number inserted into the string of letters at random positions.\n",

    "## Implementation and use of the password card\n",
    "My recommendation is not to use the password card for financial, email accounts or highly used social media accounts. These accounts, which are high value, and which I'll call Tier 1 accounts, should have 16 to 20 character random character strings used as passwords. Tier 1 passwords should be written in a password book and kept secure. Furthermore, a dedicated computer should be used for financial Tier 1 accounts, not one that has been used for general web surfing and might have become infected from daily contact with the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generating the password card requires a computer and the ability to run the Python code shown in this notebook. The computer has most likely been connected to the internet at some time or is currently connected to the internet. This may not be acceptable if you have a high level of paranoia. Most people would be OK with generating, printing the card and then deleting or encrypting the backing up the files. A password card can be printed by copying the grid of characters to a word document for formatting and printing. Highlight alternate columns and font to Courier New size 12 for printing and lamination. Making an encrypted copy of the password card word document would probably be OK for most people. The printer and home computer are behind a locked door and the generation and use of the password card can be kept relatively private. After the card is printed, it could be laminated to make it more durable. You can find instructions for laminating cards online by using a household iron.\n",
    "\n",
    "The secret phrase used with the password card should be written down somewhere until it becomes committed to memory. Additionally, 2FA should be enabled wherever it is available.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Security analysis\n",
    "The purpose of this section is to perform an analysis of the password card and look at the security properties. A hacker will try to exploit exploit weaknesses found in the design or usage of the password card. Two common analysis techniques are black-box and white-box analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "A black-box analysis is an attack that works independently of the password algorithm. The most common black-box analysis is the brute-force search, where all known combinations are tried. A modified version is to try weak or short passwords, rather than an exhaustive search.\n",
    "\n",
    "The opposite of a black-box analysis is a system where the inner components or logic are available for inspection. This is commonly referred to as a white-box or glass-box. This looks at the analysis from the point of view that the attacker knows how the algorithm works. \n",
    "\n",
    "The security analysis will look at both points of view, with zero knowledge and complete knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis of password card random characters\n",
    "As described above, the secrets library can be used to generate the password's random characters. The selection of letters, numbers and special characters is cryptographically random. Variations in the character set usually involve choosing the special characters. In this notebook, the following character sets are used. \n",
    "\n",
    "| character set | |\n",
    "|---|---|\n",
    "|lower| abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz |\n",
    "|upper| ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ |\n",
    "|digits| 0123456789 |\n",
    "|special| !@#\\$%^&*()-+=<>? |\n",

This was done to satisfy restrictive password policies. The second six characters are constructed similarly. This means that the password card will have at most three uppercase characters in the first group. Similarly, the same goes for lower case, digits and specials. This limitation can be exploited and reduce the search space. The code generating the password card will include at least one character from each group, but as a consequence, strings of five digits are excluded. This means that not all possible combinations are included in the password.\n",

    "The PIN digits are not protected by any additional secrets. Someone who has access to your password card can read your PIN's directly. For example, if you lose your wallet containing your ATM card and your password card, someone can use the card to access your funds. To defend against this, you could offset the PIN numbers used either by physical position or by adding modulo 10 some secret offset. In other words, actual PIN's are shifted left or right by some position or the numbers offset in value by some amount; or maybe both.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Threat model\n",
    "In this section attacks against passwords will be examined. A password or passphrase is typically a string of characters or a list or words, that can be random and is a secret shared between the individual and the computer system that confirms their identity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Threat modeling is a risk analysis exercise where potential threats and mitigations are identified. In this notebook I'll be looking at threats directly made on the password itself.    \n",
    "\n",
    "### Attacks against passwords\n",
    "Phishing, Man-in-the-Middle and Key-Logging attacks attempt to steal the password as does the so-called \"\\$5 wrench attack\". Because these attacks do not exploit a weakness in the password itself, they are not covered in this analysis. Mitigations against password cracking threats will be discussed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Credential Stuffing: Credential based attacks occur when attackers use previously cracked passwords at many different sites, looking for passwords that have been re-used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionary attacks: Password lists, Dictionary, word mangling: These attacks occur when attackers use dictionary lists of known cracked passwords, dictionary words and word mangling to attempt to guess passwords.\n",
    "\n",
    "Brute force: This attack involves trying all combinations of characters up to some limit, looking for short passwords. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples of bad and compromised passwords\n",
    "Examples of bad and compromised passwords are: Youknow123, drowssap, My2password, Qwerty12345@, StephenASmith1, Andrew24, ZaqXsw12, Johnny#12345, P@55w0rd, Jp1234567890, abdcefg, password, monkey, 123456, password, qwerty, football, baseball, welcome, abc123, 1qaz2wsx, dragon, master, monkey, letmein, login, princess, qwertyuiop, solo, passw0rd, starwars\n",
    "\n",
    "Most systems enforce some level of password complexity, for example: Passwords need characters from all three of the following categories:\n",
    "- Uppercase characters\n",
    "- Lowercase characters\n",
    "- Non-alphanumeric characters\n",
    "\n",
    "Most people use similar patterns (i.e. capital letter in the first position, a symbol in the last, and a number in the last 2). Password crackers know this, so they run their dictionary attacks using the common substitutions, such as \"\\$\" for \"s\", \"@\" for \"a,\" \"1\" for \"l\" and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Counter measures \n",
    "The counter measures that can be used to strengthen passwords are those that limit attacks to brute force attacks. Using unique passwords for each login prevents compromised passwords from being used against other sites. Using passwords that are long and complex should be used. Dictionary words, combinations of words or names should not be used. Typical word mangling, letter substitutions pre and post pending of special characters or numbers are well known techniques for obfuscating dictionary words or names and should not be used. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Other mitigation\n",
    "[Multi-factor authentication (MFA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication) is an additional verification step used to gain access to an online account. Typically, secret questions, codes sent to your phone or hardware tokens are used as the second factor. MFA increases security because if one credential becomes compromised, unauthorized users will be unable to meet the second authentication requirement and will not be able to access the targeted physical space, computing device, network, or database. MFA should be enabled whenever it is supported. Web pages typically ask for MFA when an attempted login is from an unrecognized device or browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Password entropy\n",
    "Austrian physicist Ludwig Boltzmann explained [entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy) as the measure of the number of possible microscopic arrangements or states of individual atoms and molecules of a system that comply with the macroscopic condition of the system. Password entropy is a measurement of how unpredictable or how hard it would be to try to guess the password. The number represents how many guesses one would have to make to try all the possible combinations. Depending on the system for which the password is being set up, the length of the password and the type characters allowed may be limited or the selection of certain characters enforced. \n",
    "\n",
    "The strength of a password depends on the password entropy and the speed of the password security algorithm. Websites that are running old versions of security software protect users passwords with password hash algorithms that run very fast. If such a password file was hacked, the password cracking tools could try password guesses at a high rate and would have a higher chance of finding the password and spend less time doing so. Websites that are running up to date security software have implemented modern password hashing algorithms that run very slow on purpose. In this case the hacker, when trying a brute force attack could only cycle through his guesses at a slow rate. Documents that are password protected are typically protected with encryption that runs very fast. In this case password cracking tools can try passwords at a very high rate.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Password entropy is defined by the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$E = log_2(R^L)$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:  \n",
    "E = number of bits of entropy  \n",
    "R = size of the pool of unique characters or elements or choices  \n",
    "L = number of items taken from the pool to form the password  \n",
    "\n",
    "The number E can be used to compare the strength of various password schemes, provided that R is determined correctly. For example the password \"$\\text{i6[y>Z#G#Y%q%Qh}$\", which is 15 characters in length and has an entropy of 94.8 bits, since some ambiguous characters have been excluded. The password \"$\\text{alongside gloss gigahertz yelp traffic}$\", which is made from five random words chosen using [Diceware](https://std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html) with the word list from [EFF's New Wordlists for Random Passphrases](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/07/new-wordlists-random-passphrases) has an entropy of 65 bits because R is the size of the word list and not the number of characters in the password. Eight Diceware words are needed to have enough entropy to exceed the 15 character password entropy. See calculations below."

    "### Use of mnemonic and acronym passwords\n",
    "There is a widely recommended formula that claims to build strong passwords called the mnemonic strategy. This strategy is often presented in articles on computer security when making recommendations for having strong passwords. This strategy starts with a memorable sentence or phrase, the words are abbreviated and combined to form a password with substitutions to include special characters and numbers. Two interesting papers on this topic can be found [here](https://faculty.ist.psu.edu/axx29/publications/ccs_16.pdf) [1] and [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221166436_Human_selection_of_mnemonic_phrase-based_passwords) [2]. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the mnemonic technique, passwords can be made by taking the first letter of each word or the last letter of each word. Other variations are possible such as omitting vowels or taking the first two letters from each word. Common substitutions or permutations are employed or numbers and special characters are appended. Some examples are shown below. \n",

    "The mnemonic passwords are long and complex and presumably easier to remember than 15 characters of gibberish. \n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with \"thcawortc1234\" as a password, is that it is derived from a pool of song lyrics, maybe popular or obscure, it doesn't matter; the pool of lyrics is not vast enough to be secure. A hacker could quickly run through all song lyrics, phrases from literature and poems, religious texts and build passwords to test with all variations of the mnemonic schemes described above. Notice how each of these is a fairly simple phrase and easy to remember. By stringing together a couple words, long passwords are created. Including a few symbols, numbers, or uppercase letters somewhere in the passphrase also increases its strength, but this is an illusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with these seemingly clever schemes is that humans are not very random and the pool of passwords or pass phrases based on mnemonic or acronym passwords is not very large. Maybe to a human, it seems large, but a hacker can program a computer to test all variations in a short amount of time. Additionally, you should be using a unique password for each account, so you might have one hundred of these mnemonic passwords to remember. When combined with the password card, a mnemonic or acronym secret word would be OK and provide a sufficient level of security as long as the password card remained private. An online tool should not be used to generate the mnemonic.\n",

    "In reference [2], a dictionary attack was made against mnemonic passwords. The authors used web scraping code to gather phrases from \n",
    "advertising slogans, children’s nursery rhymes and songs, movie quotes, famous quotations, song lyrics and television theme song lyrics. In total, they gathered over 249,000 phrases of which 129,000 phrases generated passwords with eight or more characters. Their mnemonic dictionary made from the mnemonic password rules and substitutions contained 400,000 items.

    "### False entropy estimates\n",
    "Determining the entropy pool size can sometimes be difficult, especially if a human invented choosing method is used to generate passwords that people can remember. Password entropy estimates often just look at the number of characters in the password and not the size of the pool. This can sometimes give an entropy estimate that is much larger than it actually is. A correct entropy computation works over the process by which the password was generated. We should assume that the attacker is aware of the process, but lacks knowledge of the actual choices since they are random.\n",
    "\n",
    "Referring to [1] and [2], I get the sense that human generated passwords have an entropy of 2 bits per character. The reason is that passwords chosen by humans roughly reflect the patterns and character frequency distributions of ordinary English text, and are chosen by users so that they can remember them. Users who choose passwords for themselves, because they are not chosen at random, the passwords will not have a uniform random distribution. \n",
    "\n",

    "Risk analysis: Typically, risk analysis involves looking at the likelihood of an occurrence and then examining the severity of the consequences. We can adopt the position that all accounts should get a strong password regardless of the account or the consequences of that account being hacked. Nevertheless, email, heavily used social media and financial accounts belong in Tier 1 and should have very strong passwords and probably not candidates for the password card. Other accounts such as news sites and online shopping can have login passwords that do not need the same level of strength and can make use of the password card.\n",

    "4. Trudy, an intruder, finds, steals or copies Alice's password card. In this case, Trudy also knows Alice's user name and the letters of the columns used in the password card. The only information Trudy does not possess is Alice's secret word or pass phrase.\n",
    "5. Craig, a hacker, tricks Alice into loading a virus or visiting a malicious site and logs Alice's password. He can employ various tools or techniques such as key logging, phishing, website spoofing or shoulder surfing.\n",

    "## Analysis of alternatives\n",
    "There are several password management schemes that are typically used. Assuming that unique passwords are being used for each login, there might be about 100 passwords that a typical user would need to keep track of. Three password management schemes are considered.\n",
    "- Password book: This is a handwritten password list in notebook, perhaps organized alphabetically in a binder. Use some sort of offline method and create good passwords. Keep the notebook in a secure place. Pros and cons of a computer based password manager verus a password book are discussed [here](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/175075/password-manager-vs-password-book). A password book can be purchased [here](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=password+book&language=en_US&crid=D1BZOEGM9LTS&linkCode=ll2&linkId=2a5ae88e4a78a8007c7270b5acabd639&sprefix=password+book%2Caps%2C91&tag=pbippznm-20&ref=as_li_ss_tl). Backups of a password notebook can be made by photocopying (or scanning) the pages and keeping the backup in a safe deposit box. Other than banks and other financial institutions, most web sites will put a cookie on your computer and allow you to re-visit the site without re-logins. \n",
    "- Password card: A password card is also a paper solution, and one suitable to carry on a daily basis. A Password Card is a credit card-sized card which lets you pick very secure passwords, without having to remember them. Backups of the password card can be a photocopy which is kept in a secure location.\n",
    "- Computer based password manager: There are various options available and this is a big topic of discussion online. Some type of password manager is appropriate for most people and might require a subscription. Computer based password manager requires a very strong master password because it protects all your other passwords.\n",
    "- Combination of alternatives: A combination of a Password book, Password card and Computer based password manager can also be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically the options are paper based and computer based. Paper based solutions are only as secure as the storage location of the password book. A password book locked in your house at home and its existence is not known is pretty secure because no one is actively looking for such a book. Needless to say, you should not be carrying around your password book in your backpack with the words \"passwords\" on the front of it. A password book could be used to record all your passwords of which only a few are needed on a daily basis and the password card could be used for those needed more frequently or when away from home.\n",
    "\n",
    "Web based passwords managers can be hacked. For example, Lastpass reported on December 22, 2022, that a threat actor was able to copy a backup of customer vault data from the encrypted storage container. The encrypted fields remain secured with 256-bit AES encryption and can only be decrypted with a unique encryption key derived from each user’s master password. Web based password managers are not recommended for financial or email accounts, mainly for two reasons. 1) They represent an attractive target with large payoff potential. 2) It breaks the don't put all your eggs in one basket rule. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you use a password manager like LastPass or 1Password, it stores a list containing all of the user names and passwords for the sites and apps you use, including banking, health care, email and social networking accounts. It keeps track of that list, called the vault, in its online cloud so you have easy access to your passwords from any device. LastPass said hackers had stolen copies of the list of usernames and passwords of every customer from the company’s servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most web browsers offer at least a rudimentary password manager. This is better than reusing the same password everywhere, but browser-based password managers are limited. In recent years Google has improved the password manager built into [Chrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome#Password_management).\n",
    "\n",
    "Computer based password managers like [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) offer a self hosted soultion in addition to the normal cloud based storage. \n",
    "\n",
    "Cloud based password managers are targets for attack. See [Bitwarden password vaults targeted in Google ads phishing attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/bitwarden-password-vaults-targeted-in-google-ads-phishing-attack/) which describes how Bitwarden and other password managers are being targeted in Google ads phishing campaigns to steal users' password vault credentials. Most password managers are cloud-based, allowing users to access their passwords through websites and mobile apps. These passwords are stored in the cloud in \"password vaults\" that keep the data in an encrypted format, usually encrypted using users' master passwords. Recent security breaches at LastPass and credential stuffing attacks at Norton have illustrated that a master password is a weak point for a password vault.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, threat actors have been spotted creating phishing pages that target your password vault's login credentials, potentially authentication cookies, as once they gain access to these, they have full access to your vault. [Typosquatting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typosquatting) also called URL hijacking, a sting site, or a fake URL, is a form of cybersquatting, and possibly brandjacking which relies on mistakes such as typos made by Internet users when inputting a website address into a web browser. Should a user accidentally enter an incorrect website address, they may be led to any URL (including an alternative website owned by a cybersquatter).\n",
    "\n",
    "The typosquatter's URL will usually be one of five kinds, all similar to the victim site address:\n",
    "- A common misspelling, or foreign language spelling, of the intended site\n",
    "- A misspelling based on a typographical error\n",
    "- A plural of a singular domain name\n",
    "- A different top-level domain: (i.e. .com instead of .org)\n",
    "- An abuse of the Country Code Top-Level Domain (ccTLD) (.cm, .co, or .om instead of .com)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once in the typosquatter's site, the user may also be tricked into thinking that they are in fact in the real site, through the use of copied or similar logos, website layouts, or content. \n",
    "\n",
    "Spam emails sometimes make use of typosquatting URLs to trick users into visiting malicious sites that look like a given bank's site, for instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The domain used in the ad was 'appbitwarden.com' and, when clicked, redirected users to the site 'bitwardenlogin.com.' The page at 'bitwardenlogin.com' was an exact replica of the legitimate Bitwarden Web Vault login page. \n",
    "\n",
    "Users should always configure Multi-factor authentication in the password manager. In case credentials are inadvertently entered into a phishing site, your multi-factor authentication should prevent a total breach. Unfortunately, even with MFA protection, your accounts can still be vulnerable to advanced adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) phishing attacks. AiTM phishing attacks are when threat actors utilize specialized toolkits like Evilginx2, Modlishka, and Muraena to create phishing landing pages that proxy to legitimate login forms at a targeted service. Using this method, visitors to the phishing page will see a legitimate service's login form, such as Microsoft 365. When they enter their credentials and MFA verification codes, this information is also relayed to the actual site. Once a user logs in and the legitimate site sends the MFA-backed session cookie, the phishing toolkit can steal these tokens for later use.\n",

    "[KeepassX](https://www.keepassx.org/) is a password manager that is offline.\n",
    "\n",
    "A master password is required for a [password manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_manager). The master password for a password manager is similar to having just one password, since with the master password all other passwords in the vault can be obtained. The Password Manager will encrypt the user's password vault with something like AES-256 using a key derived from the master password. But if the master password is weak, then the derived 256 bit key does not provide a AES-256 level of protection. \n",
    "\n",
    "A cloud based password manager requires a very strong master password, especially if all your sensitive account credentials are protected by the password manager. A 256 bit AES key derived from a process that starts with 90 equivalent bits of entropy is not 256 bits strong, but is only 90 bits strong. For example a pass phrase of four random words taken from a word list of 255,000 words, provides an equivalent password entropy of 72 bits."
