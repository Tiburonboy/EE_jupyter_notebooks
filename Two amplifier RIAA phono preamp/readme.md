This JypyterLab notebook analyizes the circuit for the RIAA preamp given in the Texas Instruments application note AN346, [High-Performance Audio Applications of the LM833](https://www.ti.com/lit/an/snoa586d/snoa586d.pdf), shown in the app note as Figure 3. The schematic for the phono preamplifier was entered into [LTSpice](https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/design-tools-and-calculators/ltspice-simulator.html) and the circuit net list was generated. A circuit analysis method called the [Modified Nodal Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modified_nodal_analysis) was used to derive the symbolic circuit equations and Python libraries were used to solve the equations. The preamplifier transfer function was used to calculate the Bode, impuse and step response plots. The Python results were compared to those from LTSpice. Deviation from the RIAA response curve was also examined. The sensitivity, Monte Carlo and worst case analysis for the preamplifier circuit was performed. The JupyterLab notebook show cases the use of Python in electrical engineering and circuit analysis.
