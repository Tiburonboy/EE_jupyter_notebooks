This Jupyter notebook examines the design of a small hydroelectric water wheel built by [Kris Harbour Natural Building](https://www.krisharbour.co.uk/). The water wheel is a 2.1 meter diameter wheel and he expected to generate between  1.5 and 1.7 kW. The project is documented in four YouTube videos, links are here: [Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7l5xxIGiW7o), [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvgeSJKlNUs), [Part 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DInwut0DzTQ), [Part 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPICp3c_qIQ) and [Part 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWTgMWRc2W4). The videos provide some technical details, but not enough to satisfy me. My JupyterLab notebook will cover the project description, the water wheel design, generator, flume, inverter and other topics he did not address such as instrumentation, safety, maintenance, reliability and economics.
